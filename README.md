Data To Decisions Qlik Journey Through LendingClub Issued Loans Analysis (Qlik)

The "LendingClub Issued Loans Analysis" project focuses on examining loan data from LendingClub, a leading peer-to-peer lending platform. The objective is to gain insights into borrower profiles, loan characteristics, and repayment performance, as well as to identify risk factors associated with loan defaults. Using LendingClub's publicly available dataset, this analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The aim is to develop models that can predict loan outcomes, thus aiding in better risk assessment and decision-making for both LendingClub and its investors. This project seeks to provide actionable insights that can enhance lending practices, improve investor strategies, and guide borrowers in understanding loan approval criteria.

MAIN BUSINESS PROBLEM USED IN THIS PROJECT:

Lending Club faces the task of optimizing its underwriting criteria to attract creditworthy borrowers while minimizinng default risk. The business problem in analyzing Lending Club loans
could be centered around optimizing investment decisions, Risk management, investor confidence, pricing strategy and borrower satisfaction. Difficulties in predicting loan default rates exacerbate this problem hindering the institution's capacity to proactively manage risk and optimize portfolio performance

The impacts of the "Data to Decisions: Qlik Journey Through LendingClub Issued Loans Analysis" project are significant and multifaceted. Firstly, inaccurate risk assessments and failure to predict loan defaults previously led to substantial financial losses due to bad debts. This project has mitigated such losses by enhancing the precision of risk evaluations. Secondly, the project has addressed operational inefficiencies by streamlining lending processes, thereby saving time and resources and boosting overall operational efficiency. Thirdly, the absence of data-driven insights previously placed the institution at a competitive disadvantage, lagging behind competitors who harness advanced analytics to refine their lending strategies. This project now equips LendingClub with robust analytical tools, helping it stay competitive. Lastly, inconsistent and inaccurate lending decisions in the past led to customer dissatisfaction and a loss of trust. By improving the consistency and accuracy of lending decisions, the project has enhanced customer satisfaction and restored trust in the institution
